🔬 Overview

This white paper presents a clinically deployable framework linking the Endocannabinoid System (ECS) to mitochondrial immunometabolism, fatigue reversal, and longevity recalibration.  
It maps the interaction of CB1, CB2, FAAH, MAGL, and TRPV1 with AMPK, SIRT1, NAD+, and mTOR — reframing ECS as a mitochondrial middleware system.

📌 Core Focus Areas:
- ECS control of mitochondrial energy output and redox balance
- Clinical stackable protocols for chronic fatigue, long COVID, aging, and neurodegeneration
- Integration of CBD, PEA, β-caryophyllene, resveratrol, NMN, and SCFAs into mitochondrial ECS stacks
- FAAH/MAGL tone correction as therapeutic energy logic
